# Laboratory Exercise 6: Error Detection
These are my solutions for this exercise.

To compile and run, do:
```
cargo run -- <command>
```

## Available commands
- Simple Parity Check:
    ```
    spc "Input A" "Input B"
    ```

- Two-dimensional Parity Check:
    ```
    tpc "data"
    ```

- Checksum:
    ```
    checksum "data"
    ```

- Cyclic Redundancy Check:
    ```
    crc "data"
    ```
